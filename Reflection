A. How did HTML, CSS, and JavaScript help you build your portfolio, and what challenges did you face?


HTML provided the structural foundation for my portfolio by organizing all the content into logical sections. I used semantic elements to create a header section containing my profile information, name, course details, and the theme toggle button. The main container was structured with a left section for achievements and projects, which made the content easy to navigate and understand. HTML allowed me to incorporate links to my achievement certificates and GitHub project repositories, making the portfolio interactive and informative.
CSS transformed the basic HTML structure into a visually appealing design. I implemented a custom color scheme using CSS variables, which made it easy to manage colors throughout the stylesheet. The light theme used warm, cream-colored backgrounds (#fff8d6) with yellow accents, creating a friendly and approachable look. I applied flexbox for the layout, positioning the content sections side-by-side on larger screens. The styling included rounded borders for the profile image, box shadows for depth, smooth transitions for hover effects, and a cohesive design that made my portfolio look professional.
JavaScript added essential interactivity through the theme toggle function. The toggleTheme() function uses classList.toggle() to switch between light and dark modes by adding or removing the "dark" class from the body element. This was implemented without page reloads, providing a smooth user experience. When the dark theme is activated, the background changes to dark gray (#1e1e1e), text becomes light-colored, and the button styling inverts, creating a comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions.
The main challenges I faced included:

Linking files correctly – Initially, ensuring that the CSS and JavaScript files were properly linked to the HTML file required careful attention to file paths and naming conventions.
Managing the color scheme – Balancing the light and dark theme colors to ensure good readability and aesthetic appeal in both modes took several iterations.
Responsive considerations – While the portfolio works well on desktop, I realized that the layout could be improved for mobile devices by adding media queries to stack sections vertically on smaller screens.
Image integration – Making sure the profile image displayed correctly required proper file naming and understanding how GitHub Pages serves static files from the repository.

B.  What did you learn from publishing your portfolio on GitHub Pages?
  
Publishing my portfolio on GitHub Pages taught me several valuable lessons about web deployment, version control, and the practical aspects of making a website publicly accessible.
Understanding Git and version control was the first major learning experience. I learned how to create commits with meaningful messages every time I made changes to my HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files. This process taught me the importance of tracking changes incrementally, which makes it easier to identify and fix issues if something breaks. The ability to see the history of my project and understand what changed between versions gave me confidence in my development workflow.
Configuring GitHub Pages introduced me to the deployment process. I learned that enabling GitHub Pages requires navigating to the repository settings, selecting the correct branch (main), and specifying the root folder. I also discovered that after pushing changes, there's a brief delay while GitHub's servers build and deploy the updated website. Understanding this deployment pipeline helped me appreciate the automation that happens behind the scenes when hosting static websites.
File path management became critical when working with GitHub Pages. I learned that all file references must be relative and correctly spelled – for example, ensuring that <img src="profile.jpg"> matches the exact filename uploaded to the repository. Unlike working on a local machine where file systems are more forgiving, web hosting requires precision. This taught me to be meticulous about file organization and naming conventions.
The public nature of GitHub repositories made me more conscious of code quality and documentation. Knowing that my repository and portfolio are publicly accessible motivated me to write cleaner code, use proper indentation, and include meaningful comments. This experience simulated a professional development environment where code quality matters.
Troubleshooting deployment issues enhanced my problem-solving skills. When my portfolio didn't display correctly at first, I learned to check the GitHub Actions tab to monitor the build process, verify that all files were committed, and ensure that the base URL was configured correctly. This debugging experience taught me patience and systematic troubleshooting approaches.
The accessibility of web hosting was eye-opening. The fact that I can now share my portfolio with anyone simply by providing a URL (https://pjmVillaraiz.github.io/portfolio/) makes my work visible to potential employers, instructors, and peers. This real-world application of my skills is more meaningful than just submitting files to a learning management system.
